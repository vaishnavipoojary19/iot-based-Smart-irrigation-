This project is based on lot enable smart irrigation
aim:
This project is based on lot enable smart irrigation Smart irrigation systems are designed with a multifaceted set of objectives that collectively aim to revolutionize traditional irrigation practices. The overarching goal is to address challenges related to water scarcity, environmental impact, and resource inefficiencies in agriculture and landscaping. Here, we delve into a more comprehensive exploration of the objectives for smart irrigation. The objectives of moisture sensors revolve around efficient water management, resource conservation, and improved agricultural practices. Here are the key objectives: Precision Irrigation:Provide accurate and real-time measurement of soil moisture levels to enable precise irrigation scheduling. Water Conservation:Facilitate the conservation of water by ensuring that irrigation is only applied when the soil moisture drops below optimal levels, preventing overwatering. Optimal Plant Health:Contribute to optimal plant health by maintaining soil moisture levels within the range suitable for specific crops, preventing both water stress and waterlogging. Resource Efficiency:Enhance resource efficiency by optimizing water usage, reducing the overall water footprint of agricultural and landscaping activities. The objectives of humidity and temperature sensors revolve around providing accurate environmental data for various applications. Here are the key objectives: Climate Monitoring:Provide real-time and accurate measurements of humidity and temperature to monitor and understand climate conditions. Indoor Comfort:Contribute to indoor comfort by ensuring optimal temperature and humidity levels for occupants in residential, commercial, and industrial spaces. Energy Efficiency:Support energy-efficient HVAC systems by providing data that enables precise control over heating, ventilation, and air conditioning based on environmental conditions.

FEATURES: 
smart irrigation systems incorporate various features that leverage technology to enhance efficiency, conserve water, and optimize resource usage. Here are some key features of smart irrigation: Soil Moisture Sensors:Integration of soil moisture sensors enables real-time monitoring of soil moisture levels, allowing precise and data-driven irrigation decisions. Weather Forecast Integration:Incorporation of weather forecasts helps the system adjust irrigation schedules based on upcoming weather conditions, preventing unnecessary watering during or after rain. Automated Irrigation Scheduling:Automation allows for the scheduling of irrigation cycles based on predefined parameters, optimizing water usage without manual intervention. Remote Monitoring and Control:Smart irrigation systems often provide remote monitoring and control capabilities, allowing users to access and adjust settings from mobile devices or computers. Water Flow Monitoring:Monitoring water flow rates ensures that the irrigation system is operating within optimal parameters, helping to detect leaks and irregularities. Drip Irrigation Integration:Integration with drip irrigation systems facilitates targeted and efficient water delivery directly to the root zone of plants, minimizing water wastage. Mobile Applications:User-friendly mobile applications provide an intuitive interface for users to monitor, control, and customize their irrigation settings from anywhere. Predictive Analytics:Utilization of predictive analytics analyzes historical data to forecast future irrigation needs, optimizing water usage over time. Adaptive Irrigation:Adaptive irrigation adjusts watering schedules and durations based on factors such as plant type, growth stage, and seasonal variations. Flow Sensors:Integration of flow sensors helps monitor the actual flow of water through the irrigation system, providing insights into water consumption and detecting irregularities. Smart Controllers:Smart irrigation controllers use advanced algorithms to determine optimal irrigation schedules, considering factors like soil moisture, weather forecasts, and plant requirements. Integration with IoT Platforms:Connectivity with Internet of Things (IoT) platforms enables a more interconnected and intelligent irrigation system, allowing for seamless data exchange and coordination with other smart devices. Energy-Efficient Pumping Solutions:Implementation of energy-efficient pumping solutions helps minimize the energy consumption associated with water delivery in the irrigation system. User Alerts and Notifications:Smart irrigation systems can send alerts and notifications to users, providing information about system status, maintenance requirements, or irregularities in water flow.

algorithm:

Step 1: start

Step 2: Initialize the system

Step 3: Read the PIR, moisture sensor from soil and tank

step 4: Receive the observed data

Step 5: analyze the data

Step 6: if motion detected, buzzer get activated, if no re-read the PIR sensor.
If the soil is dry, it start the irrigation process, or else re-read the moisture in the soil.
If the tank level below the below the threshold , motor will turn on , if no re-measure
the tank level .

Step 6 : stop
